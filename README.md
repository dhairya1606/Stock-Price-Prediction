# Stock-Price-Prediction
Developed a Stock Price Prediction Model: Implemented a
predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks to forecast future stock prices based on historical
financial data.
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Processed large
stock datasets by normalizing data, creating training sequences,
and engineering features from historical closing prices to enhance
model accuracy.
Visualized Model Performance: Plotted predicted vs. actual stock
prices using Matplotlib, providing clear insights into model
performance and the accuracy of predictions for financial
decision-making
